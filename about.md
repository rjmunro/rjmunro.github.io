### Senior web developer in Oxford, UK

I have over 25 years experience developing websites, web applications and mobile applications. My
recent roles have been developing scalable client-side and server-side applications using Typescript
and NodeJS. This experience, combined with my knowledge of databases like Postgres and MySQL, has
enabled me to deliver high-quality software that drives business success.

I have been described by colleagues as a "git wizard" and have given talks on the version control
system. I have written pre-commit hooks to check code for linting errors before committing and worked
on a tool to eliminate merge conflicts caused by linting fixes to a codebase. I have written a tool
to find the last place in history that on old branch will rebase to without conflicts, which often
makes resolving rebase conflicts easier. I've used git as a front end to svn in an svn-only company
using the git-svn plugin which enabled me to manage my versions and commits locally then merge them
centrally when they were tested and ready.

I know my way around Github and Gitlab's CI services, including advanced configurations that ran
different kinds of tests depending on different triggers and tests that contribute code back to the
original repository. I have also used CircleCI, AWS Codebuild, Travis and Jenkins in the past. I have
made a small [contribution](https://github.com/mislav/hub/pull/2704) to the original github "hub"
command to fix a bug when a single commit has a large number of CI jobs.

I like to ensure all configuration is managed as code and tracked in source control. I've written a
[tool](https://github.com/rjmunro/redash-loader) to extract the query and dashboard configuration
from a Redash BI server and store it as a series of YAML, SQL and JSON files that can be committed to
git, allowing the state to be tracked, branched and reverted. It can also be loaded into other
Redash instances running similar databases in different locations. I have recent experience managing
dependencies with npm and yarn for Javascript/Typescript and poetry for python. I have also used
Ruby's bundler and PHP's composer.

I have managed docker containers, optimising built containers to contain only the runtime binaries
without the build tools. I've used docker-compose to orchestrate containers.

I'm experienced with Agile working practises and have led planning, retrospective and daily stand up
meetings. I enjoy working with product owners to find innovative solutions that improve customer
experience at the same time as streamlining development.

### Hobbies

In my spare time I have a volunteered in audio-visual operation since I was a young teenager. I have
about 20 years experience about once a month as a sound engineer, but I now mostly direct and vision
mix live multi-camera video for YouTube Live streams and IMAG (Image MAGnification - i.e. the
screens for the audience in the room). This often involves managing two separate video feeds at once
because there are live hosts who are shown in the stream but not in the IMAG, or when a presenter
has slides that should stay on the screens in the room, but the presenter should be shown to the
stream.

I've contributed extensively in the early days of MusicBrainz, OpenStreetMap and Stack overflow.
I've made many small contributions to various open-source projects on Github, fixing bugs, improving
documentation, and adding small features.
